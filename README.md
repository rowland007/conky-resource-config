This is my personal configuration file. Information below is more about **Conky**.

**Conky** is a free, light-weight system monitor for X, that displays
any kind of information on your desktop.

   usage**, disk usage, **"top"** like process stats, and **network
   monitoring**, just to name a few).

   own scripts and programs ([more](Lua Interface)).
