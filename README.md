# Conky Resource Configuration File

This is my personal configuration file. Information below is more about **Conky**.

### Purpose

This repository is to make my Conky configuration more streamlined. I use to keep a copy of my `.conkyrc` file but would always have to modify it and also add the image and other scripts to get the overall experience I want. Through a series of scripts, it will add Conky to the startup applications and its required scripts.

### TODO

- [x] Add: Retrieve Public IP Script
- [x] Add: Laptop Setup Script
- [x] Add: Startup Application File (conky.desktop)
- [ ] Make: Turn repository into `.deb` package

----

**Conky** is a free, light-weight system monitor for X, that displays
any kind of information on your desktop.
